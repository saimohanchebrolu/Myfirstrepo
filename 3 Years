End User Computing & Device Management
1. How do you manage and troubleshoot device compliance issues in Intune?

Use the Intune admin center to check compliance status per device/user.

Review compliance policies applied (e.g., encryption, password, OS version).

Investigate non-compliant devices via device details and logs.

Common fixes include forcing device sync, checking device enrollment status, updating OS or apps, and ensuring compliance with conditional access policies.

Example: A device failing compliance due to outdated OS can be remediated by pushing a patch or notifying the user.

2. Explain the process to deploy Win32 applications via Intune. What challenges have you faced?

Prepare the Win32 app by packaging files with Microsoft’s Win32 Content Prep Tool into .intunewin format.

Upload to Intune, configure detection rules, install/uninstall commands, and requirements.

Assign to device/user groups.

Challenges: Handling complex install commands, silent install parameters, dependency management, and reliable detection rule configuration to avoid reinstall loops.

3. How do you perform an SCCM client health check and fix common client issues?

Check client registration status in SCCM console under Devices.

On the client, review ccmexec service status, logs like ClientIDManagerStartup.log, and LocationServices.log.

Common fixes: Reinstall client using ccmsetup.exe /uninstall then reinstall, reset WMI repository, repair network or boundary group assignments.

4. What are the differences between user and device collections in SCCM? How do you decide which to use?

User collections group users, useful for deploying user-targeted software or policies.

Device collections group devices, better for machine-based installs or configurations.

Decision depends on deployment type and scenario — e.g., deploy an app to all users regardless of device use user collections; for OS deployments, device collections.

5. Describe a time you used GPO to fix a group policy conflict or replication issue. How did you identify and resolve it?

Used tools like gpresult /r and Group Policy Modeling to identify conflicting GPOs.

Checked SYSVOL replication using repadmin commands.

Resolved by adjusting GPO link order, enforcing a GPO, or fixing replication issues with DFSR logs and restarting services.

Cloud & Identity Management (Entra ID / Azure AD)
6. How do you configure and troubleshoot Azure AD Connect sync errors?

Use Azure AD Connect Health and Synchronization Service Manager to view sync status and errors.

Common errors include attribute conflicts, duplicate objects, or permission issues.

Resolutions involve fixing attribute data, filtering sync scope, or re-running sync with Start-ADSyncSyncCycle.

7. What are the benefits and limitations of Password Hash Sync vs Pass-through Authentication?

Password Hash Sync: Copies hashed passwords to Azure AD, allows cloud authentication even if on-prem is down.

Pass-through Auth: Authenticates users against on-prem AD directly; no password stored in cloud.

Benefits: Hash sync is simple, pass-through keeps password validation on-prem for compliance.

Limitations: Pass-through depends on on-prem availability; hash sync less suitable for strict compliance.

8. How do you secure Azure AD identities beyond MFA? Describe Conditional Access policies you've implemented.

Conditional Access enforces access control based on conditions like location, device compliance, app sensitivity.

Policies include requiring compliant devices, blocking legacy auth, requiring MFA for risky sign-ins, or restricting access from specific countries.

Example: Blocking access from untrusted networks unless device is Intune compliant.

9. What’s the difference between managed and federated identities in Azure AD?

Managed identities are stored and authenticated entirely by Azure AD (e.g., cloud-only users).

Federated identities use an external identity provider (like ADFS) to authenticate users, with Azure AD trusting that provider.

Federation enables single sign-on for on-prem users.

10. How do you monitor sign-in logs and audit logs for suspicious activity in Entra ID?

Use Azure AD Sign-in logs and Audit logs in the Azure portal.

Look for failed sign-ins, unfamiliar locations, or impossible travel indicators.

Set up alerts for risky sign-ins or admin changes using Azure Sentinel or Microsoft Defender for Identity.

Linux Administration
11. Describe a scenario where you automated routine Linux server maintenance tasks using shell scripts.

Created scripts to clean /tmp directories, rotate logs, and backup configuration files.

Scheduled via cron for regular execution.

Example: Automated daily backup of /etc with timestamp and email notification on failure.

12. How do you troubleshoot a slow-running Linux server? What commands and steps do you take?

Use top or htop to check CPU and memory usage.

iostat and vmstat to analyze disk IO and paging.

Check running processes for high resource usage (ps aux --sort=-%cpu).

Investigate logs (/var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages) for errors.

Check network load with netstat or iftop.

13. Explain how you would analyze and resolve a memory leak caused by a Linux service.

Monitor memory over time with top or ps.

Use pmap or smem to inspect process memory maps.

Run the application with valgrind or massif to identify leaks during testing.

Restart service as temporary fix; escalate to dev for code fix.

14. What Linux permissions issues have you faced and how did you fix them?

Users unable to access shared directories due to incorrect group ownership or restrictive permissions.

Fixed by adjusting permissions with chmod and ownership with chown/chgrp.

Used ACLs (setfacl) for fine-grained access control when needed.

15. How do you use cron jobs for scheduling backups or log cleanups? Provide an example crontab entry.

Use crontab -e to edit cron jobs.

Example: 0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh runs backup script daily at 2 AM.

Ensure scripts have proper permissions and log output for auditing.

Tools & IT Operations
16. What are the key features of ServiceNow CMDB, and how does it integrate with incident and change management?

CMDB stores Configuration Items (CIs) and their relationships.

Helps identify impacted services during incidents.

Enables impact analysis and root cause identification in Change Management.

Integration automates updates to incident/change records with CI data.

17. Explain how you have used ServiceNow automation to improve IT service delivery.

Automated incident assignment using business rules and workflows.

Created SLA escalations and notifications.

Built catalog workflows to streamline service requests and approvals.

18. Describe your experience working with SAP MM module in procurement. How do you handle PO discrepancies?

Verified PO details using ME23N.

Coordinated with vendors and finance for invoice verification.

Used MIRO for matching invoices to PO and GR.

Raised discrepancy reports and processed credit memos when necessary.

19. How do you validate and clean large datasets in Excel before reporting?

Remove duplicates, check for blank or incorrect entries.

Use data validation rules to restrict input.

Use formulas (ISERROR, TRIM) to clean data.

Apply filters and conditional formatting to spot outliers.

20. Give examples of Excel formulas or features you used to track IT KPIs or ticket trends.

PivotTables to summarize tickets by status, priority, or assignee.

COUNTIF to count tickets meeting certain criteria.

DATEDIF to calculate ticket resolution times.

Charts to visualize trends over time.
