Section 1: Fundamentals and Architecture
1. What is SCCM and what are its primary functions?

SCCM is a systems management software by Microsoft used to manage large groups of computers. Primary functions include:

Software deployment: Installing, updating, and uninstalling software.

Patch management: Deploying software updates.

Operating System Deployment (OSD): Imaging and deploying OS on new or existing devices.

Inventory management: Collecting hardware/software info.

Compliance settings: Ensuring systems meet configured standards.

Remote control and endpoint protection.

Example: A company uses SCCM to push Office updates to all company PCs on a scheduled basis.

2. Explain the architecture of SCCM and its main components.

SCCM architecture typically involves:

Site Server: Core component running site services.

Site Database: Stores site data (usually SQL Server).

Management Point (MP): Handles client communication.

Distribution Point (DP): Stores and distributes software packages.

Reporting Point: Runs reporting services.

Fallback Status Point (FSP): Tracks client installation issues.

Clients: Agents installed on managed devices.

Example: When a client requests software, it contacts the MP to get instructions and downloads content from the DP.

3. What is a site system in SCCM? Name some key site system roles.

A site system is a server that hosts one or more SCCM roles.

Key roles:

Management Point (MP): Communication point for clients.

Distribution Point (DP): Content distribution.

Software Update Point (SUP): Integration with WSUS for patching.

Reporting Services Point (RSP): Enables reporting.

Fallback Status Point (FSP): Helps track client install issues.

4. How does SCCM handle client communication and management?

Clients communicate with MP via HTTP/HTTPS to receive policy, send status, and report inventory. They download content from DPs. Clients periodically check-in for policies, software updates, and tasks.

5. What are the different site types in SCCM?

Primary Site: Manages clients and handles full SCCM functions.

Secondary Site: Used in remote locations for content distribution; requires a parent primary site.

Central Administration Site (CAS): Manages multiple primary sites in a hierarchy (used in very large environments).

Section 2: Client Management
6. How do you deploy the SCCM client to devices?

Methods:

Client push installation: From console, SCCM pushes client installer.

Group Policy Object (GPO): Using Active Directory startup scripts.

Manual installation: Running CCMSetup.exe on device.

Software Update-based installation: Deploy client as an update.

Provisioning package: Used for Windows Autopilot or OSD.

Example: Client push is commonly used by admins to quickly install clients on all discovered devices.

7. What are the prerequisites for SCCM client installation?

Network connectivity to SCCM site.

Firewall ports (80, 443) open for communication.

Admin rights on target device.

Windows OS supported by SCCM version.

Required Windows components installed.

8. How do you troubleshoot SCCM client installation failures?

Check log files (ccmsetup.log, client.msi.log) on target device.

Verify network access and firewall rules.

Confirm DNS and AD settings.

Ensure no previous incomplete client installs.

Use Client Push Installation wizard to retry.

9. How do you verify client health and compliance?

Use built-in Client Health Dashboard in SCCM or run compliance reports. Check client activity logs like ClientIDManagerStartup.log and LocationServices.log.

10. What are client settings, and how do you configure them?

Client settings define behavior such as hardware inventory schedules, power management, software update settings, and user experience. Configured in SCCM console under Administration > Client Settings, and deployed to collections.

Section 3: Software Deployment and Updates
11. How does software deployment work in SCCM?

Admin creates an application/package, distributes content to DPs, then deploys to collections as required or available. Clients receive policy, evaluate deployments, and install software accordingly.

12. What are collections in SCCM and how are they used?

Collections are logical groups of devices or users used to target deployments. Collections can be static (manually updated) or dynamic (query-based).

Example: A “Sales Department” collection can be targeted for installing sales-specific applications.

13. Explain the difference between required and available deployments.

Required: Mandatory installation; users get forced installs.

Available: Optional; users can choose to install from Software Center.

14. How do you deploy software updates using SCCM?

Configure SUP role, synchronize updates from WSUS, create Software Update Groups (SUG), deploy updates to device collections with maintenance windows and deadlines.

15. What is Software Update Point (SUP) and how is it configured?

SUP is a site system role integrating SCCM with WSUS to provide patch management. Configured by adding the SUP role, specifying products/classifications, and syncing updates.

Section 4: Operating System Deployment (OSD)
16. What is Operating System Deployment in SCCM?

OSD automates OS installation or upgrade on client devices using task sequences.

17. Explain the steps involved in creating and deploying a task sequence.

Create boot image (WinPE).

Capture or import OS image.

Create task sequence with steps: format disk, apply OS, install drivers, software, run scripts.

Deploy task sequence to a collection.

PXE boot or media boot clients to trigger deployment.

18. How do you capture and deploy a custom OS image?

Use a capture task sequence to create a .wim file from a reference computer, import image into SCCM, then deploy via task sequence.

19. What is PXE boot, and how is it used in OSD?

PXE boot enables a device to boot over the network to WinPE boot image to start OSD without physical media.

20. How do you troubleshoot failed OSD deployments?

Check logs like smsts.log on client (WinPE environment), verify network/PXE service availability, validate boot image and driver packages.

Section 5: Reporting and Compliance
21. How do you generate reports in SCCM?

Use SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) integrated with SCCM, run built-in or custom reports from Monitoring > Reporting.

22. What is Configuration Baseline and Configuration Item in SCCM?

Configuration Item (CI): Defines settings to check on clients.

Configuration Baseline (CB): Group of CIs deployed to collections to assess compliance.

23. How does SCCM ensure compliance management?

By deploying CBs and monitoring compliance results, SCCM can enforce or report non-compliant systems.

24. Explain the role of Desired Configuration Management (DCM) in SCCM.

DCM evaluates if clients meet defined configurations and settings, helps automate remediation and compliance reporting.

25. How do you monitor deployment status and client activity?

Use SCCM console monitoring nodes, deployment status messages, and reporting for success/failure stats.

Section 6: Security and Maintenance
26. How do you secure SCCM infrastructure and client communications?

Use HTTPS for client communication, configure PKI certificates, enable role-based access control (RBAC), and secure SQL Server.

27. What are maintenance windows in SCCM?

Scheduled timeframes when clients can perform installations or reboots to minimize user disruption.

28. How do you perform SCCM backup and recovery?

Use SCCM Backup Site Server Maintenance Task or manual SQL Server backups; recovery involves reinstalling site server and restoring database.

29. What is the role of boundaries and boundary groups in SCCM?

Boundaries define network locations (IP, AD sites) to associate clients with site systems. Boundary groups group boundaries and define content sources and site assignment.

30. How do you handle SCCM site server and database maintenance?

Regularly monitor SQL health, rebuild indexes, archive logs, maintain disk space, and update site server with latest patches.
